> You've learned Vue and can create amazing front-end interfaces, but how do you make sure they really work?  With Jest, ESLint, and browser dev tools, you can look under the hood and see how well your interface is really working. Instructor Fikayo Adepoju explains the benefits of well-tested code, then delves into how to set up your testing tools. Fikayo goes over everything you need to start unit testing, including testing strings using matchers, organizing tests, testing asynchronous code, and more. He shows you how to test Vue.js components and how to use Chrome DevTools and Vue.js Devtools to debug your application. Plus, Fikayo steps through functional and automated testing in Cypress and CircleCI.
